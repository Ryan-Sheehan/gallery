The Fall 2019 semester of my junior year I suggested we do a completely in the dark seating of a 5 course meal for T86. I got the idea from a restaurant I had visited in Montreal by the name of Onoir where all of the servers are blind or sight impaired and you have the option of guessing what you're being served. The name of the event then became Onoir as an homage. I made the promotional materials and also covered my house in many layers of aluminum foil after researching how denizens of Alaska keep their rooms dark when the sun stays up for 23 hours a day. We wanted the food elements to be texturally surprising and thought up items such as carbonated caramel apples and white chocolate chai ice cream shells (pictured below).
