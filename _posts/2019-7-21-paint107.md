During the Fall 2019 semester I wanted to host a party where we covered an entire room (floor and ceiling included) in paper, got everyone white painters coveralls, and had them paint whatever they wanted anywhere to see how drastically the room would transform over the course of the night. 

For the invite, I built a simple static site, hosted in an AWS bucket, and registered the domain paint107.com. You can visit it here at [https://www.paint107.com/](https://www.paint107.com/). For the background, I found a web gl water shader and messed with it so that instead of very slight gradations to give the effect of shimmering water it now displayed high contrast block colors which gave it the feel of paint being thrown around.

To set up the room I covered everything first in plastic sheeting and then in butcher paper. On top of that I put empty printouts of ornate frames like you might see in the MFA to encourage interaction in certain areas as a starting point. In addition to the frames I scattered a number of giant paint by numbers around the room for those who couldn't be bothered. Here's how the room looked throughout the night:
