These illustrations were for an exploration into what a portfolio in quantum computing might involve. Many of the illustrations provide metaphors for some of the more complex ideas in the field such as fault tolerant quantum computers (i.e. quantum computers that can provably detect when an error occurs much like classical computers can tell when a bit has flipped improperly), entanglement (changing one particle will inexplicably change another in an equal and opposite way if it is entangled), or secure communication which features a strange aspic of a letter encased in jello which is describing the way that when you send information that has been encrypted using quantum protocols you will know with certainty if it has been tampered with (i.e. if the jello has been disturbed). I really enjoyed making these and like the way a lot of them came out. These assets were also featured at their own booth during nationwide IDEO conference (pictured below). I also heard that the CEO of [Palmwood](https://www.palmwood.org/) took some for his desk ðŸ‘€.
