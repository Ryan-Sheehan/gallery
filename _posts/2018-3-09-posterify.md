This design takes advantage of the scannable codes Spotify assigns to all of its songs/playlists. 8 of the 9 codes featured here are supplied by friends and 1 by myself. Each person nominated a favorite playlist of theirs to be featured as designated by their code. The poster itself draws inpsiration from retro-cool.
