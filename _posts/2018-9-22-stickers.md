My sophomore year I wanted to mass produce a bunch of stickers for no other purpose than I thought it was funny that by putting stickers in places people will inevitably look you make it so they have no choice but to entertain your idea no matter how stupid even if just for a second. As such the stickers all have nonsens aphorisms such as:

{% include image.html path="stickers/epicenter.png" path-detail="stickers/epicenter.png" alt="" %}

I found a wholesaler on Alibaba who would sell me 1,000 of these for a reasonable price and then made my own website to sell them around campus and it's been fun to see the way that they have circulated around independent of me. The website can be found here at [stickersforthebored.com](http://www.stickersforthebored.com/).
