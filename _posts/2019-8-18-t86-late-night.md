Last semester T86 held an event where for one night only anyone on Tufts campus could order
food from a website/server I built in a day and we would deliver it to them.
We fulfilled about 100 orders. I also used this project to complete my final project for my cybersecurity class by including a number of scripts that recorded as much information from each visitor of my website as possible including information such as general location, wifi speed, the angle their devices gyroscope was reporting, what sites they were currently logged onto elsewhere, among a lot of other things. Two birds one stone. It should be noted that I deleted this information immediately after completing this project. You can read the report [here](http://ryanwsheehan.com/116_FINAL.pdf) if you so desire.
