A design [BlackMath](http://blackmath.com/) gave me that [I built out](https://nostalgic-mccarthy-9e7c04.netlify.com)

In my time there I also did work for [Kineticards](https://www.kineticards.com/), Facebook and Harvard Business School. I will make a more in depth explanation of all of these on my updated portfolio site when no longer under NDA.
