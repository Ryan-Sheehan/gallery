I took an AI course and for my final project wrote a Q-Learning agent that figures out how to master the Google Chrome loading screen easter egg. You can check that out here at [https://musing-mclean-135420.netlify.com/](https://musing-mclean-135420.netlify.com/). It takes a little time for it to learn how to play, be patient.
